## ⚡ About This Submission

This project was assigned with a **72-hour deadline**.

- 🗓️ **Day 1**: I had my **final university exam** and couldn't start the project.
- 🗓️ **Day 2**: As someone **completely new to React and MUI**, I dedicated the entire day to **learning** and understanding both technologies from scratch.
- 🗓️ **Day 3**: I began **implementing** the project with the knowledge I had just acquired.

Although the project is **incomplete**, this experience clearly reflects my ability to **learn fast**, adapt to new tools under pressure, and apply them in real-time.
